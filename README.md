# ✈️ Flight Price Prediction

This project predicts flight ticket prices using various machine learning models, with a deployed web app for live user interaction.

🔗 **Live App**: [Streamlit Web App](https://flightpriceprediction-4mpfk4xahodbp6lkutm3ub.streamlit.app/)

## 📘 Overview

Flight ticket prices fluctuate based on multiple factors like airline, source, destination, time, and duration. In this project, we:
- Used the official flight dataset from **EaseMyTrip**
- Performed extensive **data cleaning** and **feature engineering**
- Applied multiple ML models to find the most accurate predictor
- Built a **Streamlit app** for real-time predictions

## 🚀 Models Used

We trained and evaluated the following regression models:

- **Linear Regression**
- **Random Forest Regressor**
- **LGBM Regressor**

✅ **Best Model**: After evaluation, **Random Forest Regressor** performed the best with the highest accuracy and lowest error.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn** – Data analysis and visualization
- **Scikit-learn** – ML modeling
- **LightGBM (LGBM)**
- **Streamlit** – Web app framework
- **Joblib** – Model serialization

## 📊 Dataset Information

- 📌 **Source**: Official data from **EaseMyTrip**
- 📄 **Features**:
  - Airline
  - Source & Destination
  - Journey Date
  - Departure & Arrival Time
  - Total Stops
  - Duration
  - Price (Target)

🌟 Features
Clean, interactive UI for predictions

Automatic feature preprocessing

Real-time predictions based on user input
